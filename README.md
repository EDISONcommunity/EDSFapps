#  Matching CVs based on EDISON Data Science Competencies (CF-DS)

The aim of the research that produced this tool was to accurately portray the competencies of data scientists by using the CF-DS and to make this tool available and usable for data scientists and recruiters. The proposed solution has three components, a timeline indicating the career path of the data scientist, a graph showing competency scores based on document similarity, and a graph showing competency scores based on the career path. The best method to get an accurate overview of a data scientistâ€™s competencies at this point in time, is to use all three components of the tool that was developed. The developed CV assessment tool and application provides an effective instrument for recruiters to assess CVs which allows them to decide on the most suitable candidates. It is also a useful tool for job seekers and practitioners to assess their competencies and identify a path for professional development.

### Components

This project contains a back end and front end component. 

The back end is written in Python and uses Flask.
The front end is written using the Angular framework.

Read the README.md in both component folders for installation instructions and on how to run the project.

When the front end and back end have both been started, the front end can be used to upload a CV. The back end will process the data and return an object that will be visualised by the front end.
