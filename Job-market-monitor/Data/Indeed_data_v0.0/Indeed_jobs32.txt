Kentivo is looking for people to pick up these challenges and join us in our adventure. As a company we look to maximize our diversity both in terms of culture, skills and expertise as we believe that at the cross-sections innovations happen that are relevant. We are currently looking for people to strengthen our team in the Netherlands and in Germany area.

PS. As most of us are coffee drinkers, we are interested to learn more regarding the art of Tea. Hence having expertise in this domain is a plus.

When you look in the mirror and recognize yourself in this, we very much like to meet and start a discussion regarding possibilities.
Artificial Intelligence is part skills part artHaving a large selection of options allows you to blend on the spotThings should get done & get done wellA perfect blend can only be judge by the customer.Europe is your playgroundYou do not grasp the concept of “Impossible”
In the spirit of openness, be aware, Kentivo has its limits:
We don’t offer comfortable 9.00 – 17.00 positions. (we get things done, even if we have to make hell freeze over)We don’t offer a stage for coordinators and managers. (we like to get our own hands dirty)We don’t offer predictability. (we are thrill seekers with a passion for professionality, technology and information)We don’t have job descriptions. (every person is different, so how can all job descriptions be the same?)
