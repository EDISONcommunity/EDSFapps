Kentivo - Trainee Data Scientist Vacature - Kentivo - Utrecht | Indeed.nlMaking things possible, requires striving to apply now technology to make organizations better. True witchery is not to just innovate or want to learn yourself but really apply it and create magic than can go into production. At Kentivo we strongly believe in the attitude of the Witches:
“It is most unlikely. But-here comes the big "but"-not impossible.”
The possibilities with technology change all the time. What might be impossible yesterday might be old-fashioned tomorrow. This requires acting beyond the standard roads well-travelled, recombine the old into new innovations and add magic to an established world. Connect block-chain with artificial intelligence, link Tensorflow with SAP solutions or create a virtual Cassandra people believe.
But be aware, at Kentivo we have our quirkiness. To put it in the language of Roald Dahl:

A little nonsense now and then, is relishedSplatch-winkle is our continuous state of operationWe want to give our customers solutions like dishes with crodscollopWe do not dwell on standard magic, we create unique potions for our clients from standard ingredients.
In the spirit of openness, be aware, Kentivo has its limits:

We don't offer cozy 9.00 - 17.00 positions.
We don't offer a stage for prima-donna's.
We don't offer predictability.
We don't have job descriptions.
Don't hesitate to respond with a one-page background of yourself that we can use as a conversation starter.
