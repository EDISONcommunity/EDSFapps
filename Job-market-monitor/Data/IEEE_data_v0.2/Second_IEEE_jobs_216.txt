Title: Electronic Warfare (EW) Modeling, Simulation & Analysis (MS&A) Engineer
 


Position: Full Time
Level: Research Engineer/Scientist I/II




Primary Location: Dayton, OH


Travel Required: 10% time




Lab: Electronic Systems Laboratory (ELSYS)


Reporting To: Rich Rowland




Job Description: 
The Dayton Operations Branch (DOB) of the ELSYS Systems Engineering Research Division is seeking qualified individuals to lead and contribute to a wide range of programs developing tools and performing Systems Engineering and Modeling & Simulation analysis of advanced systems with a focus on Electronic Warfare (EW) for our various sponsors at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB).
As part of the research team in Dayton the position affords many opportunities to interface and work directly with the sponsors on base at WPAFB including the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC).
GTRI and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) are complementary institutions that work together to solve customers’ technical problems. Our strong connection to Georgia Tech opens the door to the vast intellectual resources of one of America’s leading research universities. We offer stability, world-class benefits and a flexible career path in an applied research and development environment.
 




Requirements:

Develop and execute state-of-the-art modeling and simulation tools to perform critical analysis of system performance
Develop and integrate scripts to allow researchers to gather and analyze critical data from the simulation runs
Assist in the design, development, and demonstration of simulation experiments
Perform and document analysis on system performance
Interface regularly with sponsors at WPAFB

Education:  B.S., M.S or Ph.D degree in Electrical/Computer/Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or related fields.
Experience: Systems Engineering and especially MS&A experience desired; but a background in research, design and analysis in any science or engineering related field accepted.
Desired Technical Skills:  (not all required, experience in one is sufficient)

MATLAB, C/C++, Python, Fortran
Strong math skills and ability to learn complex engineering concepts
Knowledge of Electronic Warfare (EW) domain
Experience with Modeling and Simulation (especially standard Air Force models such as AFSIM, Suppressor, ESAMS, or STORM)
Familiarity with Linux and open source tools
Configuration management tools (git preferred)
Ability to clearly communicate technical ideas to non-technical audience
Ability to work independently as well as in a dynamic team environment

Other: Candidate must be a US citizen capable of holding a Secret DoD security clearance, active clearance a major plus.
