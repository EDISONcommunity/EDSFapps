 Research Software Engineer Stanford University
Job Number: 78769 Job Title: Research Software EngineerDo you enjoy software development in an academic environment? Do you have a passion for open source? Do you want to contribute to the growing field of medical computing and precision medicine? The Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab, together with the Stanford Research Computing Center (SRCC), is seeking a full-time software engineer to serve as lead developer of the open source SimVascular project. Funded by the NSF and based on over a decade of research and development, SimVascular is state-of-the-art in cardiovascular modeling, from medical image data to blood flow simulations. The research team includes engineering faculty and students at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCLA. A primary goal is to integrate cutting-edge research developments into distributable software releases. The ideal candidate will have interest and experience in medical computing, software development, and a track record of open source contributions. In this role, your activities and responsibilities may include developing new plug-ins for cardiac modeling; within the open source software ecosystem, responding to bug and feature requests, developing benchmarks and test suites, and documenting capabilities/feature; integrating advanced image segmentation methods for patient-specific model construction, including machine learning and AI methods; interfacing and importing tools into virtual reality environments; and traveling to academic conferences to run workshops and tutotials.The ideal candidate will have these skills:

Significant programming experience, including C++, Qt, Python, object-oriented programming, and strong integration skills. Additional experience with ITK/VTK is a plus.
Interest in open source scientific software. Track record of contributions is a plus.
