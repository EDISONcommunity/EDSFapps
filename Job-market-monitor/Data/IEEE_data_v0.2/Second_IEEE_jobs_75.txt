Do you like working in a collaborative, team-oriented environment? Do you enjoy solving complex system or system-of-systems problems through model-based systems architecting and systems engineering approaches? Would you like to advance the state-of-the art in the use of systems models? The MITRE Architecture Analytics Department is looking for well qualified architects and systems engineers who can apply the model-based family of languages, methods, and tools to analyze a complex system or system-of-systems and gain insights about capability outcomes. By applying model-based techniques architects and systems engineers promote mission success, functional integration, and resource optimization in support of decision-making for an enterprise environment. This position can be located in McLean, VA; Huntsville, AL; San Diego, CA; or Aberdeen, MD.Key Functions: Apply deep understanding of model-based architecture and systems engineering best practices to improve or transform systems capabilities of DoD and/or intelligence community (IC) enterprise information environments  Use state-of-the-art systems modeling languages, methods, and tools to develop and evolve complex system/system-of-systems architectures and technical solutions  Enable the creation, sharing, and understanding of architecture and systems engineering models and artifacts to support more effective and timely decisions  Define capability and interoperability gaps, overlaps, opportunities, and constraints  Use systems models to assess the impact of proposed changes on component or constituent systems  Provide model-based analysis and recommendations for capability modernization and investment decisions  Enable process and data integration across a program / organization and with mission partners through the use of model-based processes, methods, artifacts, tools, and analysis  Train and educate sponsor and MITRE personnel on the proper use of systems models across the architecture and engineering continuum of practice to meet functional requirements and mission needs  Work within an evolving programmatic environment with evolving requirements and capability goals










							Required Qualifications: Eight+ years of experience in developing and evolving enterprise information environments through the practical application of systems architecting and systems engineering best practices  Proficient in the use of multiple architecture frameworks, tools, and methodologies  Proficient is the use of systems modeling languages, methods, and tools  Ability to identify and implement model-based architecture and engineering methods and standards  Experience building systems models, conducting analysis, and providing recommendations within a team environment on multiple projects  Experience applying modeling, analysis, and design activities to support planning and decision-making to improve / transform a system / system-of-systems environment  Demonstrated experience in use of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and systems modeling methods, such as Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM)  Demonstrated experience with at least one systems modeling tool: (preferred) NoMagic, MagicDraw or IBM Rational Rhapsody; others considered if applicable  Experience reporting on capabilities and options through the lens of architecture and engineering analysis delivered in a standardized way through model-based approachesPreferred Qualifications: MS or PhD in a technical discipline, such as Systems Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Statistics, or Mathematics  Experience in the practical application of systems architecting and model-based systems engineering (MBSE)  Knowledge and understanding of the structures, behaviors, and constraints associated with a system / system-of-systems environment  Experience with architecture frameworks, such as DoDAF, UAF, and TOGAF, and related modeling profiles, such as Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM)  Knowledge and understanding of reference architectures and their use  Ability to be cleared up to a Top Secret security clearance level
