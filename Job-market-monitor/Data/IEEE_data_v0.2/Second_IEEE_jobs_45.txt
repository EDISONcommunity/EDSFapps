We are seeking a R&D S&E, Electrical Engineer to support the development, specification, and testing of electrical components and to support development and testing of unique Mk21 AFA configurations needed for flight and ground test activities. The tasks for this position include electrical AFA functional testing and acceptance, AFA tester operation to collect ground qualification test data, clarification of requirements, planning and procurement of prototypes, test planning, analysis of test/analysis data for design performance, design definition and documentation, and communication of program status and engineering data to customers and Sandia management. The work for this position is focused on the electrical engineering aspects of these tasks. This position will also include a variety of interactions across the program including coordination with partner organizations across the laboratory and external interaction with the Air Force, NNSA, LLNL, SNLCA, and other agencies. Some travel may be required to support development, test and program needs. Successful candidate(s) will be self-directed, customer-focused, and have strong teaming and analytical skills.
On any given day, you may be called on to:

Support the completion of functional and interface component requirements
Update design definition and documentation
Support the testing and evaluation of prototype hardware
Support integrated tester development for component and AFA prototypes
Provide technical leadership in identifying and managing technical risks
Analyze system performance against requirements
Assess, plan, and report progress relative to program plans

Department Description:
The Mk21 Arming and Fuzing Assembly (AFA) Qualification Department (2342) is responsible for leading the qualification and requirements verification effort for the MK21 AFA. The Mk21 AFA is deployed into Air Force ICBM Weapon Systems. These fuze technologies share strong synergy with W88 ALT 370. Department 2342 is comprised of a diverse, multi-discipline team responsible for building, testing and verifying requirements to ensure successful qualification of the Mk21 AFA. The Mk21 AFA will require rigorous qualification testing including vibration, shock, thermal, electromagnetic, radiation environments, and flight tests. The department works collaboratively with the Mk21 AFA PRT department (2342) and many laboratory partners both internal and external to Sandia. This NW development project is engaged in robust development cycle which will progress through an aggressive design engineering test and evaluation phase followed by production engineering qualification leading to an FPU of 4QFY22.
