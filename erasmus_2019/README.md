# Master Thesis: Data Science competence benchmarking and customized curriculum design based on EDSF
### Università degli Studi di Perugia - Eramus+ Traineership 
### Luca Comminiello

The purpose of this project is to create an algorithm that, given a professional profile, evaluates the input candidate's Curriculum Vitae (CV)
compared to the thirty CF-DS competences and, identifying the most lacking research areas, defines the optimal learning path 
in order to fill these gaps within a few semesters. 

This tool can be used not only by universities to draw up new degree programs based on the professionals to be trained but also 
by companies to identify the training path to be proposed to new recruits and prepare them in view of their inclusion in the labour market.

The following researching questions are addressed in this thesis:
	How to use Ontology methods to optimize programmability of EDSF.
	How to improve Data Science competence assessments of candidates based on CV or multiple choice questions.
	How to design optimal learning path for candidate on target Data Science competences.
